### 👨‍💻 About Me

🏫 My name is Hoang Tran from Vietnam. Currently, I am a student majoring in Computer Science.

🙋‍♂️ I am a guy eager to learn new knowledge and try new skills. As a result, some of my hobby are reading books and learning new languages (culture as well).

🤗 Outside of the tech world, I enjoy playing sport.

💌 I dream of creating useful and awesome applications that can solve real-world problems.

✈ Traveling is also one of my favorite things to do. Traveling to at least ten countries before I turn 30 years old is one of my goals. I recently heard about the idea of "living as a digital nomad", which really intrigues me. Having a job as a developer gives me the opportunity to make that a reality.
